# FOREWORD

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers set up a committee in 1911 for the purpose of formulating standard rules for the construction of steam boilers and other pressure vessels. This committee is now called the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee.

The Committee’s function is to establish rules of safety, relating only to pressure integrity, governing the construction of boilers, pressure vessels, transport tanks, and nuclear components, and inservice inspection for pressure integrity of nuclear components and transport tanks, and to interpret these rules when questions arise regarding their intent. This code does not address other safety issues relating to the construction of boilers, pressure vessels, transport tanks, and nuclear components, and the inservice inspection of nuclear components and transport tanks. The user of the Code should refer to other pertinent codes, standards, laws, regulations, or other relevant documents. With few exceptions, the rules do not, of practical necessity, reflect the likelihood and consequences of deterioration in service related to specific service fluids or external operating environments. Recognizing this, the Committee has approved a wide variety of construction rules in this Section to allow the user or his designee to select those which will provide a pressure vessel having a margin for deterioration in service so as to give a reasonably long, safe period of usefulness. Accordingly, it is not intended that this Section be used as a design handbook; rather, engineering judgment must be employed in the selection of those sets of Code rules suitable to any specific service or need.

This Code contains mandatory requirements, specific prohibitions, and nonmandatory guidance for construction activities. The Code does not address all aspects of these activities and those aspects which are not specifically addressed should not be considered prohibited. The Code is not a handbook and cannot replace education, experience, and the use of engineering judgment. The phrase *engineering judgment* refers to technical judgments made by knowledgeable designers experienced in the application of the Code. Engineering judgments must be consistent with Code philosophy and such judgments must never be used to overrule mandatory requirements or specific prohibitions of the Code.

> *Construction, as used in this Foreword, is an all-inclusive term comprising materials, design, fabrication, examination, inspection, testing, certification, and pressure relief.*

The Committee recognizes that tools and techniques used for design and analysis change as technology progresses and expects engineers to use good judgment in the application of these tools. The designer is responsible for complying with Code rules and demonstrating compliance with Code equations when such equations are mandatory. The Code neither requires nor prohibits the use of computers for the design or analysis of components constructed to the requirements of the Code. However, designers and engineers using computer programs for design or analysis are cautioned that they are responsible for all technical assumptions inherent in the programs they use and they are responsible for the application of these programs to their design.

The Code does not fully address tolerances. When dimensions, sizes, or other parameters are not specified with tolerances, the values of these parameters are considered nominal and allowable tolerances or local variances may be considered acceptable when based on engineering judgment and standard practices as determined by the designer.

The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee deals with the care and inspection of boilers and pressure vessels in service only to the extent of providing suggested rules of good practice as an aid to owners and their inspectors.

The rules established by the Committee are not to be interpreted as approving, recommending, or endorsing any proprietary or specific design or as limiting in any way the manufacturer’s freedom to choose any method of design or any form of construction that conforms to the Code rules.

The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee meets regularly to consider revisions of the rules, new rules as dictated by technological development, Code Cases, and requests for interpretations. Only the Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee has the authority to provide official interpretations of this Code. Requests for revisions, new rules, Code Cases, or interpretations shall be addressed to the Secretary in writing and shall give full particulars in order to receive consideration and action (see Mandatory Appendix covering preparation of technical inquiries). Proposed revisions to the Code resulting from inquiries will be presented to the Main Committee for appropriate action. The action of the Main Committee becomes effective only after confirmation by letter ballot of the Committee and approval by ASME.

---

### Proposed Revisions to the Code

Proposed revisions to the Code approved by the Committee are submitted to the American National Standards Institute and published at [http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/public/index.cfm?PublicReview](http://cstools.asme.org/csconnect/public/index.cfm?PublicReview) to invite comments from all interested persons. After the allotted time for public review and final approval by ASME, revisions are published annually in Addenda to the Code.

### Code Cases

Code Cases may be used in the construction of components to be stamped with the ASME Code symbol beginning with the date of their approval by ASME.

After Code revisions are approved by ASME, they may be used beginning with the date of issuance shown on the Addenda. Revisions, except for revisions to material specifications in Section II, Parts A and B, become mandatory six months after such date of issuance, except for boilers or pressure vessels contracted for prior to the end of the six-month period. Revisions to material specifications are originated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and other recognized national or international organizations, and are usually adopted by ASME. However, those revisions may or may not have any effect on the suitability of material, produced to earlier editions of specifications, for use in ASME construction. ASME material specifications approved for use in each construction Code are listed in the Guidelines for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Section II, Parts A and B. These Guidelines list, for each specification, the latest edition adopted by ASME, and earlier and later editions considered by ASME to be identical for ASME construction.

### Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee

The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee in the formulation of its rules and in the establishment of maximum design and operating pressures considers materials, construction, methods of fabrication, inspection, and safety devices.

The Code Committee does not rule on whether a component shall or shall not be constructed to the provisions of the Code. The Scope of each Section has been established to identify the components and parameters considered by the Committee in formulating the Code rules.

Questions or issues regarding compliance of a specific component with the Code rules are to be directed to the ASME Certificate Holder (Manufacturer). Inquiries concerning the interpretation of the Code are to be directed to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee.

ASME is to be notified should questions arise concerning improper use of an ASME Code symbol.

### Material Specifications

The specifications for materials given in Section II are identical with or similar to those of specifications published by ASTM, AWS, and other recognized national or international organizations. When reference is made in an ASME material specification to a non-ASME specification for which a companion ASME specification exists, the reference shall be interpreted as applying to the ASME material specification. Not all materials included in the material specifications in Section II have been adopted for Code use. Usage is limited to those materials and grades adopted by at least one of the other Sections of the Code for application under rules of that Section. All materials allowed by these various Sections and used for construction within the scope of their rules shall be furnished in accordance with material specifications contained in Section II or referenced in the Guidelines for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Section II, Parts A and B, except where otherwise provided in Code Cases or in the applicable Section of the Code. Materials covered by these specifications are acceptable for use in items covered by the Code Sections only to the degree indicated in the applicable Section. Materials for Code use should preferably be ordered, produced, and documented on this basis; Guideline for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Section II, Part A and Guideline for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Section II, Part B list editions of ASME and year dates of specifications that meet ASME requirements and which may be used in Code construction. Material produced to an acceptable specification with requirements different from the requirements of the corresponding specifications listed in the Guideline for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Part A or Part B may also be used in accordance with the above, provided the material manufacturer or vessel manufacturer certifies with evidence acceptable to the Authorized Inspector that the corresponding requirements of specifications listed in the Guideline for Acceptable ASTM Editions in Part A or Part B have been met. Material produced to an acceptable material specification is not limited as to country of origin.

When required by context in this Section, the singular shall be interpreted as the plural, and vice-versa; and the feminine, masculine, or neuter gender shall be treated as such other gender as appropriate.

# Statement of Policy on the Use of Code Symbols and Code Authorization in Advertising

ASME has established procedures to authorize qualified organizations to perform various activities in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. It is the aim of the Society to provide recognition of organizations so authorized. An organization holding authorization to perform various activities in accordance with the requirements of the Code may state this capability in its advertising literature.

Organizations that are authorized to use Code Symbols for marking items or constructions that have been constructed and inspected in compliance with the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code are issued Certificates of Authorization. It is the aim of the Society to maintain the standing of the Code Symbols for the benefit of the users, the enforcement jurisdictions, and the holders of the symbols who comply with all requirements.

Based on these objectives, the following policy has been established on the usage in advertising of facsimiles of the symbols, Certificates of Authorization, and reference to Code construction. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers does not “approve,” “certify,” “rate,” or “endorse” any item, construction, or activity and there shall be no statements or implications that might so indicate. An organization holding a Code Symbol and/or a Certificate of Authorization may state in advertising literature that items, constructions, or activities “are built (produced or performed) or activities conducted in accordance with the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,” or “meet the requirements of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.”

The ASME Symbol shall be used only for stamping and nameplates as specifically provided in the Code. However, facsimiles may be used for the purpose of fostering the use of such construction. Such usage may be by an association or a society, or by a holder of a Code Symbol who may also use the facsimile in advertising to show that clearly specified items will carry the symbol. General usage is permitted only when all of a manufacturer’s items are constructed under the rules.

The ASME logo, which is the cloverleaf with the letters ASME within, shall not be used by any organization other than ASME.

# Statement of Policy on the Use of ASME Marking to Identify Manufactured Items

The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code provides rules for the construction of boilers, pressure vessels, and nuclear components. This includes requirements for materials, design, fabrication, examination, inspection, and stamping. Items constructed in accordance with all of the applicable rules of the Code are identified with the official Code Symbol Stamp described in the governing Section of the Code.

Markings such as “ASME,” “ASME Standard,” or any other marking including “ASME” or the various Code Symbols shall not be used on any item that is not constructed in accordance with all of the applicable requirements of the Code.

Items shall not be described on ASME Data Report Forms nor on similar forms referring to ASME that tend to imply that all Code requirements have been met when, in fact, they have not been. Data Report Forms covering items not fully complying with ASME requirements should not refer to ASME or they should clearly identify all exceptions to the ASME requirements.

# 2007 Section V

## Subsection A: Nondestructive Methods of Examination

### Article 1: General Requirements

#### T-110 Scope

(a) This Section of the Code contains requirements and methods for nondestructive examination (NDE), which are Code requirements to the extent they are specifically referenced and required by other Code Sections or referencing documents. These NDE methods are intended to detect surface and internal imperfections in materials, welds, fabricated parts, and components. They include:

- Radiographic examination
- Ultrasonic examination
- Liquid penetrant examination
- Magnetic particle examination
- Eddy current examination
- Visual examination
- Leak testing
- Acoustic emission examination

See Nonmandatory Appendix A of this Article for a listing of common imperfections and damage mechanisms, and the NDE methods that are generally capable of detecting them.

(b) For general terms such as Inspection, Flaw, Discontinuity, Evaluation, etc., refer to Mandatory Appendix L.

#### T-120 General

(a) Subsection A describes the methods of nondestructive examination to be used if referenced by other Code Sections or referencing documents.

(b) Subsection B lists Standards covering nondestructive examination methods which have been accepted as standards. These standards are nonmandatory unless specifically referenced in whole or in part in Subsection A or as indicated in other Code Sections or referencing documents.

(c) Any reference to a paragraph of any Article in Subsection A of this Section includes all of the applicable rules in the paragraph. In every case, reference to a paragraph includes all the subparagraphs and subdivisions under that paragraph.

(d) Reference to a standard contained in Subsection B is mandatory only to the extent specified.

(e) For those documents that directly reference this Article for the qualification of NDE personnel, the qualification shall be in accordance with their employer’s written practice which must be in accordance with one of the following documents:

1. SNT-TC-1A, Personnel Qualification and Certification in Nondestructive Testing; or
2. ANSI/ASNT CP-189, ASNT Standard for Qualification and Certification of Nondestructive Testing Personnel

(f) National or international central certification programs, such as the ASNT Central Certification Program (ACCP), may be alternatively used to fulfill the examination requirements of the documents listed in T-120(e) as specified in the employer’s written practice.

---

*For example, reference to T-270 includes all the rules contained in T-271 through T-277.*

*For example, T-233 requires that Image Quality Indicators be manufactured and identified in accordance with the requirements or alternatives allowed in SE-747 or SE-1025, and Appendices, as appropriate for the style of IQI to be used. These are the only parts of either SE-747 or SE-1025 that are mandatory in Article 2.*

*SNT-TC-1A (2001 Edition), “Personnel Qualification and Certification in Nondestructive Testing,” and ANSI/ASNT CP-189 (2001 Edition), “ASNT Standard for Qualification and Certification of Nondestructive Testing Personnel;” published by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, 1711 Arlingate Lane, P.O. Box 28518, Columbus, OH 43228-0518.*

# Article 1

## General Provisions

### Personnel Qualifications

- **(g)** When the referencing Code Section does not specify qualifications or does not reference directly Article 1 of this Section, qualification may simply involve demonstration in routine manufacturing operations to show that the personnel performing the nondestructive examinations are competent to do so in accordance with the Manufacturer’s established procedures.

- **(h)** The user of this Article is responsible for the qualification and certification of NDE Personnel in accordance with the requirements of this Article. The Code User’s Quality Program shall stipulate how this is to be accomplished. Qualifications in accordance with a prior edition of SNT-TC-1A, or CP-189 are valid until recertification. Recertification or new certification shall be in accordance with the edition of SNT-TC-1A or CP-189 specified in Footnote 3.

- **(i)** Limited certification of nondestructive examination personnel who do not perform all of the operations of a nondestructive method that consists of more than one operation, or who perform nondestructive examinations of limited scope, may be based on fewer hours of training and experience than recommended in SNT-TC-1A or CP-189. Any limitations or restrictions placed upon a person’s certification shall be described in the written practice and on the certification.

### Units of Measurement

- **(j)** Either U.S. Customary Units or SI Units may be used for compliance with all requirements of this edition, but one system shall be used consistently throughout for all phases of construction.

  1. Either the U.S. Customary Units or SI Units that are listed in Mandatory Appendix II are identified in the text, or are identified in the nomenclature for equations shall be used consistently for all phases of construction (e.g., materials, design, fabrication, and reports). Since values in the two systems are not exact equivalents, each system shall be used independently of the other without mixing U.S. Customary Units and SI Units.

  2. When SI Units are selected, U.S. Customary values in referenced specifications that do not contain SI Units shall be converted to SI values to at least three significant figures for use in calculations and other aspects of construction.

## T-130 Equipment

It is the responsibility of the Code User to ensure that the examination equipment being used conforms to the requirements of this Code Section.

*In this Code Section, “Code User” is any organization conducting nondestructive examinations to the requirements of this Section.*

## T-150 Procedure

- **(a)** The nondestructive examination methods included in this Section are applicable to most geometric configurations and materials encountered in fabrication under normal conditions. However, special configurations and materials may require modified methods and techniques, in which case the Manufacturer shall develop special procedures which are equivalent or superior to the methods and techniques described in this Code Section, and which are capable of producing interpretable examination results under the special conditions. Such special procedures may be modifications or combinations of methods described or referenced in this Code Section, and shall be proved by demonstration to be capable of detecting discontinuities under the special conditions, and such demonstrated capabilities shall be equivalent to the capabilities of the methods described in this Code Section when used under more general conditions. Depending on the quality assurance or quality control system requirements of the referencing Code Section, these special procedures shall be submitted to the Inspector for acceptance where required, and shall be adopted as part of the Manufacturer’s quality control program.

- **(b)** When an examination to the requirements of this Section of the Code is required by other Sections of the Code, it shall be the responsibility of the Manufacturer, fabricator, or installer to establish nondestructive examination procedures and personnel certification procedures conforming to the referencing Code requirements.

- **(c)** When required by the referencing Code Section, all nondestructive examinations performed under this Code Section shall be done to a written procedure. This procedure shall be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Inspector. The procedure or method shall comply with the applicable requirements of this Section for the particular examination method. Where so required, written procedures shall be made available to the Inspector on request. At least one copy of each procedure shall be readily available to the Manufacturer’s Nondestructive Examination Personnel for their reference and use.

## T-160 Calibration

- **(a)** The Manufacturer, fabricator, or installer shall assure that all equipment calibrations required by Subsection A and/or Subsection B are performed.

- **(b)** When special procedures are developed [see T-150(a)], the Code User shall specify what calibration is necessary, when calibration is required.

## T-170 Examinations and Inspections

- **(a)** The Inspector concerned with the fabrication of the vessel or pressure part shall have the duty of verifying.

# 2007 Section V

## Article 1

To his satisfaction that all examinations required by the referencing Code Section have been made to the requirements of this Section and the referencing document(s). He shall have the right to witness any of these examinations to the extent stated in the referencing document(s). Throughout this Section of the Code, the word *Inspector* means the Authorized Inspector who has been qualified as required in the various referencing Code Sections.

(b) The special distinction established in the various Code Sections between inspection and examination and the personnel performing them is also adopted in this Code Section. In other words, the term *inspection* applies to the functions performed by the Authorized Inspector, but the term *examination* applies to those quality control functions performed by personnel employed by the Manufacturer. One area of occasional deviation from these distinctions exists. In the ASTM Standard Methods and Recommended Practices incorporated in this Section of the Code by reference or by reproduction in Subsection B, the words *inspection* or *Inspector*, which frequently occur in the text or titles of the referenced ASTM documents, may actually describe what the Code calls *examination* or *examiner*. This situation exists because ASTM has no occasion to be concerned with the distinctions which the Code makes between inspection and examination, since ASTM activities and documents do not involve the Authorized Inspector described in the Code Sections. However, no attempt has been made to edit the ASTM documents to conform with Code usage; this should cause no difficulty if the users of this Section recognize that the terms *inspection*, *testing*, and *examination* in the ASTM documents referenced in Subsection B do not describe duties of the Authorized Code Inspector but rather describe the things to be done by the Manufacturer’s examination personnel.

### T-180 Evaluation

The acceptance standards for these methods shall be as stated in the referencing document(s).

### T-190 Records/Documentation

Records/Documentation shall be in accordance with the referencing document(s) and the applicable requirements of Subsection A and/or B of this Code Section. The Code User shall be responsible for all required Records/Documentation.

---

### ADDENDA

Colored-sheet Addenda, which include additions and revisions to individual Sections of the Code, are published annually and will be sent automatically to purchasers of the applicable Sections up to the publication of the 2010 Code. The 2007 Code is available only in the loose-leaf format; accordingly, the Addenda will be issued in the loose-leaf, replacement-page format.

### INTERPRETATIONS

ASME issues written replies to inquiries concerning interpretation of technical aspects of the Code. The Interpretations for each individual Section will be published separately and will be included as part of the update service to that Section. Interpretations of Section III, Divisions 1 and 2, will be included with the update service to Subsection NCA.

Interpretations of the Code are distributed annually in July with the issuance of the edition and subsequent addenda. Interpretations posted in January at [www.cstools.asme.org/interpretations](http://www.cstools.asme.org/interpretations) are included in the July distribution.

### CODE CASES

The Boiler and Pressure Vessel Committee meets regularly to consider proposed additions and revisions to the Code and to formulate Cases to clarify the intent of existing requirements or provide, when the need is urgent, rules for materials or constructions not covered by existing Code rules. Those Cases that have been adopted will appear in the appropriate 2007 Code Cases book: “Boilers and Pressure Vessels” and “Nuclear Components.” Supplements will be sent automatically to the purchasers of the Code Cases books up to the publication of the 2010 Code.

## NONMANDATORY APPENDIX

### APPENDIX A — IMPERFECTION VS TYPE OF NDE METHOD

#### A-110 SCOPE

Table A-110 lists common imperfections and the NDE methods that are generally capable of detecting them.

**CAUTION:** Table A-110 should be regarded for general guidance only and not as a basis for requiring or prohibiting a particular type of NDE method for a specific application. For example, material and product form are factors that could result in differences from the degree of effectiveness implied in the table. For service-induced imperfections, accessibility and other conditions at the examination location are also significant factors that must be considered in selecting a particular NDE method. In addition, Table A-110 must not be considered to be all-inclusive; there are several NDE methods/techniques and imperfections not listed in the table. The user must consider all applicable conditions when selecting NDE methods for a specific application.

# Article 2: Radiographic Examination

## T-210 Scope

The radiographic method described in this Article for examination of materials including castings and welds shall be used together with Article 1, General Requirements. Definitions of terms used in this Article are in Mandatory Appendix V of this Article.

Certain product-specific, technique-specific, and application-specific requirements are also given in other Mandatory Appendices of this Article, as listed in the table of contents. These additional requirements shall also be complied with when an Appendix is applicable to the radiographic or radioscopic examination being conducted.

## T-220 General Requirements

### T-221 Procedure Requirements

#### T-221.1 Written Procedure

Radiographic examination shall be performed in accordance with a written procedure. Each procedure shall include at least the following information, as applicable:

- (a) Material type and thickness range
- (b) Isotope or maximum X-ray voltage used
- (c) Source-to-object distance (D in T-274.1)
- (d) Distance from source side of object to film (d in T-274.1)
- (e) Source size (F in T-274.1)
- (f) Film brand and designation

### T-262.1 Densitometers
Densitometers shall be calibrated at least every 90 days during use as follows:

- **(a)** A national standard step tablet or a step wedge calibration film, traceable to a national standard step tablet and having at least 5 steps with neutral densities from at least 1.0 through 4.0, shall be used. The step wedge calibration film shall have been verified within the last year by comparison with a national standard step tablet unless, prior to first use, it was maintained in the original light-tight and waterproof sealed package as supplied by the manufacturer. Step wedge calibration films may be used without verification for one year upon opening, provided it is within the manufacturer's stated shelf life.

- **(b)** The densitometer manufacturer's step-by-step instructions for the operation of the densitometer shall be followed.

- **(c)** The density steps closest to 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 on the national standard step tablet or step wedge calibration film shall be read.

- **(d)** The densitometer is acceptable if the density readings do not vary by more than ± 0.05 density units from the actual density stated on the national standard step tablet or step wedge calibration film.

### T-262.2 Step Wedge Comparison Films
Step wedge comparison films shall be verified prior to first use, unless performed by the manufacturer, as follows:

- **(a)** The density of the steps on a step wedge comparison film shall be verified by a calibrated densitometer.

- **(b)** The step wedge comparison film is acceptable if the density readings do not vary by more than ± 0.1 density units from the density stated on the step wedge comparison film.

### T-262.3 Periodic Verification

## ARTICLE 2

### T-270 EXAMINATION

#### T-271 Radiographic Technique

A single-wall exposure technique shall be used for radiography whenever practical. When it is not practical to use a single-wall technique, a double-wall technique shall be used. An adequate number of exposures shall be made to demonstrate that the required coverage has been obtained.

##### T-271.1 Single-Wall Technique

In the single-wall technique, the radiation passes through only one wall of the weld (material), which is viewed for acceptance on the radiograph.

##### T-271.2 Double-Wall Technique

When it is not practical to use a single-wall technique, one of the following double-wall techniques shall be used.

- **(a) Single-Wall Viewing:** For materials and for welds in components, a technique may be used in which the radiation passes through two walls and only the weld (material) on the film-side wall is viewed for acceptance on the radiograph. When complete coverage is required for circumferential welds (materials), a minimum of three exposures taken 120 degrees to each other shall be made.

- **(b) Double-Wall Viewing:** For materials and for welds in components 3½ in. (89 mm) or less in nominal outside diameter, a technique may be used in which the radiation passes through two walls and the weld (material) in both walls is viewed for acceptance on the same radiograph. For double-wall viewing, only a source-side IQI shall be used. Care should be exercised to ensure that the required geometric unsharpness is not exceeded. If the geometric unsharpness requirement cannot be met, then single-wall viewing shall be used.

  1. For welds, the radiation beam may be offset from the plane of the weld at an angle sufficient to separate the images of the source-side and film-side portions of the weld so that there is no overlap of the areas to be interpreted. When complete coverage is required, a minimum of two exposures taken 90 degrees to each other shall be made for each joint.

  2. As an alternative, the weld may be radiographed with the radiation beam positioned so that the images of both walls are superimposed. When complete coverage is required, a minimum of three exposures taken at either 60 degrees or 120 degrees to each other shall be made for each joint.

  3. Additional exposures shall be made if the required radiographic coverage cannot be obtained using the minimum number of exposures indicated in (b)(1) or (b)(2) above.

*Sketches showing suggested source, film, and IQI placements for pipe or tube welds are illustrated in Article 2, Nonmandatory Appendix A.*

### T-272 Radiation Energy

The radiation energy employed for any radiographic technique shall achieve the density and IQI image requirements of this Article.

### T-273 Direction of Radiation

The direction of the central beam of radiation should be centered on the area of interest whenever practical.

### T-274 Geometric Unsharpness

#### T-274.1 Geometric Unsharpness Determination

Geometric unsharpness of the radiograph shall be determined in accordance with:

\[ U_g = Fd/D \]

where:

- \( U_g \) = geometric unsharpness
- \( F \) = source size: the maximum projected dimension of the radiating source (or effective focal spot) in the plane perpendicular to the distance \( D \) from the weld or object being radiographed
- \( D \) = distance from source of radiation to weld or object being radiographed
- \( d \) = distance from source side of weld or object being radiographed to the film

\( D \) and \( d \) shall be determined at the approximate center of the area of interest.

*NOTE: Alternatively, a nomograph as shown in Standard Guide for Radiographic Examination SE-94 may be used.*

#### T-274.2 Geometric Unsharpness Limitations

Recommended maximum values for geometric unsharpness are as follows:

| Material Thickness, in. (mm) | \( U_g \) Maximum, in. (mm) |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Under 2 (50)                 | 0.020 (0.51)                |
| 2 through 3 (50-75)          | 0.030 (0.76)                |
| Over 3 through 4 (75-100)    | 0.040 (1.02)                |
| Greater than 4 (100)         | 0.070 (1.78)                |

*NOTE: Material thickness is the thickness on which the IQI is based.*

### T-275 Location Markers

Location markers (see Fig. T-275), which are to appear as radiographic images on the film, shall be placed on the part, not on the exposure holder/cassette. Their locations shall be permanently marked on the surface of the part being radiographed when permitted, or on a map, in a manner permitting the area of interest on a radiograph to be accurately traceable to its location on the part, for the required retention period of the radiograph. Evidence shall...

### ARTICLE 2

#### T-275.1 Single-Wall Viewing

- **Source-Side Markers**: Location markers shall be placed on the source side when radiographing the following:
  1. Flat components or longitudinal joints in cylindrical or conical components.
  2. Curved or spherical components whose concave side is toward the source and when the "source-to-material" distance is less than the inside radius of the component.
  3. Curved or spherical components whose convex side is toward the source.

- **Film-Side Markers**:
  1. Location markers shall be placed on the film side when radiographing either curved or spherical components whose concave side is toward the source and when the "source-to-material" distance is greater than the inside radius.
  2. As an alternative to source-side placement in T-275.1(a)(1), location markers may be placed on the film side when the radiograph shows coverage beyond the location markers to the extent demonstrated by Fig. T-275, sketch (e), and when this alternate is documented in accordance with T-291.

- **Either Side Markers**: Location markers may be placed on either the source side or film side when radiographing either curved or spherical components whose concave side is toward the source and the "source-to-material" distance equals the inside radius of the component.

#### T-275.2 Double-Wall Viewing

For double-wall viewing, at least one location marker shall be placed adjacent to the weld (or on the material in the area of interest) for each radiograph.

#### T-275.3 Mapping the Placement of Location Markers

When inaccessibility or other limitations prevent the placement of markers as stipulated in T-275.1 and T-275.2, a dimensioned map of the actual marker placement shall accompany the radiographs to show that full coverage has been obtained.

### T-276 IQI Selection

#### T-276.1 Material

IQIs shall be selected from either the same alloy material group or grade as identified in SE-1025, or SE-747, as applicable, or from an alloy material group or grade with less radiation absorption than the material being radiographed.

#### T-276.2 Size

The designated hole IQI or essential wire shall be as specified in Table T-276. A thinner or thicker hole-type IQI may be substituted for any section thickness listed in Table T-276, provided an equivalent IQI sensitivity is maintained. See T-283.2.

- **Welds With Reinforcements**: The thickness on which the IQI is based is the nominal single-wall thickness plus the estimated weld reinforcement not to exceed the maximum permitted by the referencing Code Section. Backing rings or strips shall not be considered as part of the thickness in IQI selection. The actual measurement of the weld reinforcement is not required.

- **Welds Without Reinforcements**: The thickness on which the IQI is based is the nominal single-wall thickness. Backing rings or strips shall not be considered as part of the weld thickness in IQI selection.

#### T-276.3 Welds Joining Dissimilar Materials or Welds With Dissimilar Filler Metal

When the weld metal is of an alloy group or grade that has a radiation attenuation that differs from the base material, the IQI material selection shall be based on the weld metal and be in accordance with T-276.1. When the density limits of T-282.2 cannot be met with one IQI, and the exceptional density area(s) is at the interface of the weld metal and the base metal, the material selection for the additional IQIs shall be based on the base material and be in accordance with T-276.1.

### T-277 Use of IQIs to Monitor Radiographic Examination

#### T-277.1 Placement of IQIs

- **Source-Side IQI(s)**: The IQI(s) shall be placed on the source side of the part being examined, except for the condition described in T-277.1(b).

  1. The IQI on the source side of the separate block shall be placed no closer to the film than the source side of the part being radiographed.
  2. The separate block shall be placed as close as possible to the part being radiographed.
  3. When hole-type IQIs are used, the block dimensions shall exceed the IQI dimensions such that the outline of at least three sides of the IQI image shall be visible on the radiograph.

- **Film-Side IQI(s)**: Where inaccessibility prevents hand placing the IQI(s) on the source side, the IQI(s) shall be placed on the film side in contact with the part being examined. A lead letter "F" shall be placed adjacent to or on the IQI.

### T-277.2. Number of IQIs

When one or more film holders are used for an exposure, at least one IQI image shall appear on each radiograph except as outlined in (b) below.

- **(a) Multiple IQIs:**  
  If the requirements of T-282 are met by using more than one IQI, one shall be representative of the lightest area of interest and the other the darkest area of interest; the intervening densities on the radiograph shall be considered as having acceptable density.

- **(b) Special Cases:**

  1. For cylindrical components where the source is placed on the axis of the component for a single exposure, at least three IQIs, spaced approximately 120 degrees apart, are required under the following conditions:

     - **(a)** When the complete circumference is radiographed using one or more film holders, or:
     - **(b)** When a section or sections of the circumference, where the length between the ends of the outermost sections span 240 or more degrees, is radiographed using one or more film holders. Additional film locations may be required to obtain necessary IQI spacing.

  2. For cylindrical components where the source is placed on the axis of the component for a single exposure, at least three IQIs, with one placed at each end of the span of the circumference radiographed and one in the approximate center of the span, are required under the following conditions:

     - **(a)** When a section of the circumference, the length of which is greater than 120 degrees and less than 240 degrees, is radiographed using just one film holder, or:
     - **(b)** When a section or sections of the circumference, where the length between the ends of the outermost sections span less than 240 degrees, is radiographed using more than one film holder.

  3. In (1) and (2) above, where sections of longitudinal welds adjoining the circumferential weld are radiographed simultaneously with the circumferential weld, an additional IQI shall be placed on each longitudinal weld at the end of the section most remote from the junction with the circumferential weld being radiographed.

  4. For spherical components where the source is placed at the center of the component for a single exposure, at least three IQIs, spaced approximately 120 degrees apart, are required under the following conditions:

     - **(a)** When a complete circumference is radiographed using one or more film holders, or:

## ARTICLE 2

### Radiographic Requirements

#### Circumferential Radiography

- **Section or Sections of a Circumference:**
  - When the length between the ends of the outermost sections spans 240 degrees or more, radiography using one or more film holders is required. Additional film locations may be necessary for proper IQI spacing.

- **Spherical Components:**
  - If the source is placed at the center for a single exposure, at least three IQIs are required:
    - One at each end of the radiographed span.
    - One at the approximate center of the span.
  - Conditions:
    - For sections greater than 120 degrees and less than 240 degrees using one film holder.
    - For sections less than 240 degrees using more than one film holder.

- **Simultaneous Weld Radiography:**
  - Additional IQI required for each other weld radiographed with the circumferential weld.

- **Flat or Curved Components:**
  - For segments where the source is perpendicular to the center of a weld length for a single exposure using more than three film holders, at least three IQIs are required:
    - One at each end of the radiographed span.
    - One at the approximate center of the span.

- **Array of Components:**
  - At least one IQI must be visible on each component image.

- **Record Continuity:**
  - All radiographs with IQIs that qualify the techniques must be retained.

#### Shims Under Hole IQIs

- For welds, a shim similar to the weld metal should be placed between the part and the IQI if needed, ensuring radiographic density is no more than 15% lighter than through the IQI.
- Shim dimensions must exceed IQI dimensions to show at least three sides of the IQI image.

## T-280 EVALUATION

### T-281 Quality of Radiographs

- Radiographs must be free from blemishes that could mask or be confused with discontinuities. Blemishes include:
  - Fogging
  - Processing defects (streaks, watermarks, chemical stains)
  - Scratches, finger marks, crimps, dirtiness, static marks, smudges, tears
  - False indications from defective screens

## T-282 Radiographic Density

### T-282.1 Density Limitations

- **Minimum Density:**
  - 1.8 for X-ray source, 2.0 for gamma ray source.
  - 1.3 for each film in composite viewing.
- **Maximum Density:**
  - 4.0 for single or composite viewing.
- **Tolerance:**
  - 0.05 for densitometer reading variations.

### T-282.2 Density Variation

- **General:**
  - Density variation should not exceed minus 15% or plus 30% from the density through the IQI.
  - Additional IQI required for exceptional areas if variation exceeds limits.
- **With Shims:**
  - Plus 30% density restriction may be exceeded.
  - Minimum density requirements do not apply if IQI sensitivity is met.

## T-283 IQI Sensitivity

### T-283.1 Required Sensitivity

- Radiography must display the designated hole IQI image and the 2T hole or essential wire.
- IQI identifying numbers and letters must be visible.
- Interpretation allowed by composite film viewing if necessary.

### T-283.2 Equivalent Hole-Type Sensitivity

- A different thickness IQI may be used if equivalent or better sensitivity is achieved, meeting all radiography requirements.
